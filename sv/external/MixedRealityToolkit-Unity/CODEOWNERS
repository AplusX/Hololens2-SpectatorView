# The intent of this file is to list, on a per-file/per-area basis:
# 1) Who is the most familiar with an area of code.
# OR
# 2) Who can take a first pass at pull request review, or delegate the review
# to someone else who may be more appropriate.
#
# Note that order in this file is EXTREMELY important - the last matching
# rule will win. This means that the most general rules should be listed
# first in this file, followed by more specific rules.
