# Configuring the Boundary Visualization

The Boundary Visualization Profile provides options for configuring:

- [General Settings](#general-settings)
- [Floor Settings](#floor-settings)
- [Play Area Settings](#play-area-settings)
- [Tracked Area Settings](#tracked-area-settings)
- [Boundary Wall Settings](#boundary-wall-settings)
- [Boundary Ceiling Settings](#boundary-ceiling-settings)

Boundary visualizations are attached to the Mixed Reality Playspace object in the scene and teleport with the user.

## General Settings

![Boundary Visualization General Settings](../../Documentation/Images/Boundary/BoundaryVisualizationGeneralSettings.png)
### Boundary Height

The boundary height indicates the distance above the floor plane at which the boundary ceiling should be rendered. The default value is 3 meters.

## Floor Settings

![Boundary Visualization Floor Settings](../../Documentation/Images/Boundary/BoundaryVisualizationFloorSettings.png)

### Show

Indicates whether or not a floor plane is to be created and added to the scene. The default value is true.

### Material

Indicates the material that should be used when creating the floor plane.

### Scale

Indicates the size, in meters, of the floor plane to be created. The default scale is a 3 meter x 3 meter square.

### Physics Layer

The layer on which the floor plane should be set. The default value is the Default layer.

## Play Area Settings

![Boundary Visualization Play Area Settings](../../Documentation/Images/Boundary/BoundaryVisualizationPlayAreaSettings.png)

### Show

Indicates whether or not a play area rectangle is be created and added to the scene. The default value is true.

### Material

Indicates the material that should be used when creating the play area object.

### Physics Layer

The layer on which the play area should be set. The default value is the Ignore Raycast layer.

## Tracked Area Settings

![Boundary Visualization Tracked Area Settings](../../Documentation/Images/Boundary/BoundaryVisualizationTrackedAreaSettings.png)

### Show

Indicates whether or not the outline of the tracked area is be created and added to the scene. The default value is true.

### Material

Indicates the material that should be used when creating the tracked area outline.

### Physics Layer

The layer on which the tracked area should be sets. The default value is the Ignore Raycast layer.

## Boundary Wall Settings

![Boundary Visualization Boundary Wall Settings](../../Documentation/Images/Boundary/BoundaryVisualizationWallSettings.png)

### Show

Indicates whether or not boundary wall planes are to be created and added to the scene. The default value is false.

### Material

Indicates the material that should be used when creating the boundary wall planes.

### Physics Layer

The layer on which the boundary walls should be set. The default value is the Ignore Raycast layer.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the boundary wall component to a physics layer other than Ignore Raycast may prevent users from interacting with objects within the scene.

## Boundary Ceiling Settings

![Boundary Visualization Boundary Ceiling Settings](../../Documentation/Images/Boundary/BoundaryVisualizationCeilingSettings.png)

### Show

Indicates whether or not a boundary ceiling plane is to be created and added to the scene. The default value is false.

### Material

Indicates the material that should be used when creating the boundary ceiling plane.

### Physics Layer

The layer on which the boundary walls should be set. The default value is the Ignore Raycast layer.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting the boundary ceiling component to a physics layer other than Ignore Raycast may prevent users from interacting with objects within the scene.
