# Configuring the Diagnostics System

The diagnostics system profile provides options for configuring:
- [General Settings](#general-settings)
- [Profiler Settings](#profiler-settings)

## General Settings

![Diagnostics General Settings](../../Documentation/Images/Diagnostics/DiagnosticsGeneralSettings.png)

### Show Diagnostics

Indicates whether or not the diagnostics system is to display the configured diagnostic options.

When disabled, all configured diagnostic options will be hidden.

#### Programmatically controlling the Diagnostics System

It's also possible to toggle the visibility of the diagnostics system and the profiler at runtime.
For example, the code below will hide the diagnostics system and profiler.

```C#
if (MixedRealityServiceRegistry.TryGetService<IMixedRealityDiagnosticsSystem>(out var service))
{
    service.ShowDiagnostics = false;
    service.ShowProfiler = false;
}
```
