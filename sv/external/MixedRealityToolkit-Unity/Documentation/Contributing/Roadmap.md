## Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) Roadmap

The Mixed Reality Toolkit is an all-new product, built to be cross MR/AR/VR/XR platform by design. There are two planned pre-releases after which the Mixed Reality Toolkit will become the primary product.

The Mixed Reality Toolkit will require Unity 2018.4.

> When Unity releases an LTS (Long Term Support) product, the Mixed Reality Toolkit will update to the LTS release. MRTK will also support the latest non-beta (ex: 2019.1) tech branch version of Unity, at the time at which MRTK was released.

### 2.2.0

Status: In development

Timeline: November 2019

Themes:

- Stability
- Developer education
- Mobile AR
- User Experience
- Build Tools

**Stability**

Quality and stability are the top priority for this and all Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit releases. We will continue to prioritize customer and partner issues that impact the stability of MRTK components.

**Developer education**

[Developer documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) and example scenes are, like stability, an ongoing priority for the MRTK team.

**Mobile AR**

The Mixed Reality Toolkit will be embracing ARFoundation from Unity to add official support for mobile AR platforms (Android ARCore and iOS ARKit). Future MRTK releases will build upon this work to support Unity's XR SDK platform.

**User Experience**

User experience (UX) work will include:

- BoundingBox, Interactable and ManipulationHandler refactors
- Keyboard fixes
- Continued investments in scrollable object collection
- Profile improvements and search
- Unity UI improvements including handling active profile switching and working with Interactable
- Utilities for setting up UX elements

**Build Tools**

The Mixed Reality Toolkit build tools (Mixed Reality Toolkit > Utilities > Build Window) are intended to improve the development cycle by allowing a fast build - package - deploy loop for developers. Planned work includes:

- Fixing known issues
- Improve remoting support for Microsoft HoloLens 2
- Add support for restoring MRTK NuGet packages
