<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Validates the code to check for common patterns and usage that shouldn't be
    checked in.
.DESCRIPTION
    This currently checks:

    - That Boo.Lang isn't used anywhere in the code. This is an autocomplete option
      that occurs when using Lists and other collections - the right thing to do
      is to use System.Collections

    Returns 0 if there are no issues, non-zero if there are.
.PARAMETER Directory
    The directory containing the code to validate. Only CSharp files
.EXAMPLE
    .\validatecode.ps1 -Directory c:\path\to\MRTK\Assets
